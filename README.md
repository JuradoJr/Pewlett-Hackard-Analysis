# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project is to find out the number of employees that are retiring for each job title and also to determine which employees are qualified to participate in a mentoring program. Finally, we will create a report that will prepare the managers for the “silver tsunami” that will eventually occur due to many employees approaching the retirement age. 

## Results: 

### Work
First, we write a query to make a Retirement Titles table that shows all the employees who were born between 1/1/1952 and 12/31/1955.

We then write a new query to make a Unique Titles table that holds employee information such as numbers, first and last name, and most recent job title.

And finally, we create a query that makes a Retiring Titles table that holds the information of retiring employees’ job titles.

To get the results we are looking. For we create a query to make a table to see. Which employees born between 1/1/1965 and 12/31/1965 are eligible for mentorship.

We can see the list of employees who are eligible for retirement in the retirement table we did.

We can see the total amount of people retiring without having duplicate names from people who have received promotions in our cleaned titles table.

We can see the total amount of people retiring according to their education level such as having a specific senior title in our soon-to-retire table.

### Final Results

Our results show that a large number of employees are eligible to retire at any given time. We have a total of 72,458 employees who are eligible to retire and only 1,549 employees are eligible to receive mentorship.

## Summary:

###  How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Over 72,000 employee roles will need to be filled after adding all the employees who could retire according to their department.

### 	 Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

No there is not due to only having a little over 1,500 employees who can receive the mentorship.
